# LB-R2R-Calib
Accurate and Robust Extrinsic Calibration of Multiple Long Baseline 4D Imaging Radars for V2X
## Introduction
LB-R2R-Calib is a new algorithm to rapidly and robustly locate the target and extract the target center from  very cluttered 4D radar point cloud, based on an important observation of the 4D radar.
### Motivation
In Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), Roadside Perception Unit (RSU) is an important component to improve the perception ability for unmanned vehicles~. Moreover, fusing multiple RSU sensors can further improve the perception by extending the Field-of-View (FOV) and avoiding blind spots.
